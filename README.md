# Neuroadaptive-Feedback-Systems
This project is a desktop application built using Python and PyQt6 that simulates a real-time neuroadaptive interface.
The app visualizes EEG data, classifies the user's cognitive state—such as stress, focus, or fatigue—and 
dynamically adapts the interface based on the analysis. It is designed to demonstrate how neuroadaptive 
feedback systems can personalize digital experiences using physiological signals.

The key features of the application include real-time EEG signal visualization, live cognitive state classification,
modular interface components (such as control tabs, visualization panels, and logs), and a modern, 
responsive layout using PyQt6. While this version uses simulated EEG input, it is built to easily
integrate with real-time data from actual EEG hardware in the future.

To use the application, you need to have Python 3.10 or later installed, along with pip, the Python package manager.
After installing the necessary dependencies—which include PyQt6, matplotlib, and numpy—you can run 
the app by executing python main.py in your terminal.

The project directory includes several main files. main.py contains the core logic and launches the PyQt6 user interface. 
A future data_stream.py module will handle live or simulated EEG data input, and classifier.py will contain the 
machine learning model responsible for cognitive state classification. The project also includes a UI directory 
for layout files and an assets folder for things like logos or icons.

In its current state, the application already includes support for simulated EEG data. Planned features include improved 
signal preprocessing, implementation of a real-time classification model (such as an SVM or neural network), and a 
more advanced feedback system that could adapt lighting, software behavior, or notifications based on the user’s 
cognitive state. A mobile or web version of the interface is also considered for future expansion.

This system has applications in multiple fields. It could help monitor cognitive load in educational tools, 
support mental health by identifying and responding to stress, enhance training systems in military or 
aerospace contexts, and improve user experiences in gaming or productivity tools by responding to attention levels in real time.

The project is open-source under the MIT License, meaning you're free to use and modify it however you wish.
Development is led by LR-Bio, with inspiration drawn from neuroscience, human-computer interaction, 
and real-world biofeedback applications.
